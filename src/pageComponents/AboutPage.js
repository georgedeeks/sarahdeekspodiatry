		<Writing>
			<p>
				I graduated from the University of East London in 2013 with a BSc(Hons) in Podiatric Medicine. 
				My dissertation focused on foot diabetes and the impact it has on children.
			</p>

			<p>
				I am registered with the Healthcare Professions Council and am also a member of the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists.
				To keep up to date, I regularly attend professional development courses and keep current with the latest research.
			</p>

			<p>
				As well as a keen interest in the diabetic foot, my particular specialism is in musculoskeletal care. 
				I am particularly experienced in orthotics and have a detailed understanding of the diagnosis, treatment and prevention measures of issues related to an individualâ€™s gait.
			</p>

			<p>
				My friendly approach to treating my patients helps me discover their needs. 
				This allows me the best chance to help (and help them) maintain good foot health for their everyday life.
