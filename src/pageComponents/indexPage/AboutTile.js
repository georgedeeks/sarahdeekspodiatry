			</Heading>

			<Paragraph>
				<p>
					I graduated from the University of East London in 2013 with a BSc(Hons) in Podiatric Medicine. 
				</p>

				<p>
					I am registered with the Healthcare Professions Council and am also a member of the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists.
					To keep up to date, I regularly attend professional development courses and keep current with the latest research.
				</p>

				<p>
					As well as a keen interest in the diabetic foot, my particular specialism is in musculoskeletal care. 
					I am particularly experienced in orthotics and have a detailed understanding of the diagnosis, treatment and prevention measures of issues related to an individualâ€™s gait.
				</p>

				<p>
					My friendly approach to treating my patients helps me discover their needs, so they can
					maintain good foot health in everyday life.
