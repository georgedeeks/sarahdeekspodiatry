			<Paragraph>
				<p>
					I graduated from the 
					<b> University of East London </b> 
					in 
					2013 
					with a 
					<b> BSc(Hons) in Podiatric Medicine</b>. 
				</p>

				<p>
					I am registered with the 
					<b> Healthcare Professions Council </b> 
					and am also a member of the 
					<b> Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists</b>.
					To keep up to date, I regularly attend professional development courses and keep current with the latest research.
				</p>

				<p>
					As well as a keen interest in the 
					<b> diabetic foot</b>
					, my particular specialism is in 
					<b> musculoskeletal care</b>. 
					I am particularly experienced in 
					<b> orthotics </b> 
					and have a detailed understanding of the diagnosis, treatment and prevention measures of issues related to an individualâ€™s gait.
				</p>

				<p>
					My friendly approach to treating my patients helps me discover their needs, so they can
					maintain good foot health in everyday life.
